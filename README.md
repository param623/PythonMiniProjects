Projects
1. Pig Game
Description
The Pig Game is a classic dice game for multi players. The goal is to be the first player to reach 50 points. Players take turns to roll a die as many times as they wish, accumulating points, but losing all points for the turn if a 1 is rolled.

Rules
On a player's turn, they can roll the die as many times as they like.
Each roll adds the die's value to the player's turn total.
If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn, and their turn ends.
The player can choose to "hold," adding the turn total to their score and ending their turn.
The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game.

2. Mad Libs Generator Program
Description
The Mad Libs Generator Program allows users to create their own funny stories by filling in blanks with words such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. The program prompts the user for specific types of words and incorporates them into a pre-defined story template.
